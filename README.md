# A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style

Implementing: Gatys, L.A., Ecker, A.S. and Bethge, M., 2016, June. [Image style transfer using convolutional neural networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf). In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016 IEEE Conference on (pp. 2414-2423). IEEE.

This project provides notebooks for running through different sections of the paper and scripts that can be used to 'style' images as described by the technique in the paper. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

This project was built on Python 3.5.2.

The following modules are required:
* ```cv2 (3.4.1)```
* ```matplotlib (1.5.3)```
